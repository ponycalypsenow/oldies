2001 state of art 3d engine
---------------------------

no, not really but...

uses directx (ver. 7 i guess?), and lightwave3d modeller (ver. 6.5 or 7 if i recall correctly). compiles into less than 2-3 kilobytes, with keyframer and all the jazz.

what amazes me after these years is how many things i managed to get right - acyclic structure, clear ownership patterns, unidirectional data flow - things i have to struggle consciously these days. makes you think. it took about 3 rewrites from the ground up until it "feelt right", but that was the only guidance i had.

a later, opengl based version of the engine been used in [http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=11341](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=11341), unfortunately i can't find that code anywhere, oh well.
